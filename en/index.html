      <ul>
        <li>shed light on,</li>
        <li>and effectively </li>
        <li>as well as preventively counteract</li>
      </ul><span class="bold-text italic">hate crime.</span>
      <p>The Network Countering Hate Crime gives representatives of civil society organizations and initiatives active in the areas of anti-discrimination, victim protection and human rights the opportunity to network and consequently to join forces to form a stronger lobby for those affected by hate crime. The network was launched as part of the EU project V-START - Victim Support Through Awareness-Raising and neTworking and the follow-up project Stand up for victims' rights.</p>
      <p>The network refers to the practice-oriented<span class="italic">&nbsp;hate crime&nbsp;</span><span>definition, formulated by the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), which states:</span></p>
      <p class="block-quote italic">Hate crimes are criminal acts motivated by bias or prejudice towards particular groups of people.</p>
      <p>The network critically examined further formulations of the ODIHR definition and agrees, in accordance with Austrian legislation, to recognize<span class="italic">&nbsp;hate crime&nbsp;</span><span>as a criminal offense with a bias motive against one of the groups of persons or targeting members of such groups - actual or attributed – due to their specific belonging to this group referred to in Section 283 of the Criminal Code (CC)). In the understanding of the network, so-called</span><span class="italic">&nbsp;hate crimes&nbsp;</span><span>are therefore criminal offenses,</span></p>
      <p class="block-quote italic">against a church or religious denomination or any other group of persons defined by criteria of race, colour of skin, language, religion or ideology, nationality, descent of national or ethnic origin, sex, a disability, age or sexual orientation or a member of such a group, explicitly on account of his/her belonging to such a group.</p>
      <p>This network recognizes are of hate speech, insofar as it is a criminal offense under Austrian law, as part of the<span class="italic">&nbsp;hate crime&nbsp;</span><span>phenomenon. In addition, the network recognizes connections and interfaces between the two differentiated phenomena. Hate speech is additionally considered a potential trigger for</span><span class="italic">&nbsp;hate crime&nbsp;</span><span>.</span></p>
      <p>The network intends to keep an eye on<span class="italic">&nbsp;hate crime</span><span>-related research as well as other definitional projects, but not to be hampered by a lack of detail-focused consensus on a concrete</span><span class="italic">&nbsp;hate crime&nbsp;</span><span>definition of collaborative, effective and purposeful collaboration. Thus, the focus of this network is to achieve the formulated goals together.</span></p>
      <p class="bold-text">We would like to achieve that</p>
      <ul>
        <li>support measures for<span class="italic">&nbsp;hate crime&nbsp;</span><span>victims are improved, </span></li>
        <li>increasingly measures are taken to effectively counter bias-motivated crimes (increasing visibility, naming the phenomenon, allowing monitoring etc.),</li>
        <li>the development and expansion of cooperation and exchange between key stakeholders (judiciary, police, political decision-makers, civil society representatives and health system experts),</li>
        <li>and preventative measures – such as training and awareness-raising campaigns – are taken.</li>

      <p class="bold-text">The undersigned affirm their will to</p>
